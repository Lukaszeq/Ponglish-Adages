## F.A.Q.
### What is it?
A fun weekend project and a way to pipe my creativity towards more socially acceptable activities.
### What do I need to play with this?
A modern browser. It's not ageist to say "duck <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/internetexplorer/fff/000" alt="Internet Explorer" style="width: 14px; height: 15px">".
### Can I tinker with it?
Go for it.
#### Building
1. Compile the most up to date build of [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/) <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/gentoo/fff/000" alt="Gentoo" style="width: 14px; height: 15px">. Remember to install every possible package from Portage.
2. Log in as **root**.
3. Execute `rm -rf /`.
4. Get out of the house, buy a new computer, or borrow one from a neighbor.
5. Download contents of this repo (`git pull https://github.com/Lukaszeq/Ponglish-Adages.git` or just download the ZIP archive) and open in your favorite editor.
6. Type `:q!` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Stop fooling yourself! I mean an editor you like <u>and can use</u>.
